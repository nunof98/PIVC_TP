# Image processing and computer vision Practical Work

This Practical Work was made with the objective of attempt a work for the MsC of Electronics Enginheering in Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave for the Image processing and computer vision subject

Image processing and computer vision (José Henrique Brito - jbrito@ipca.pt )

Feb 2022, Barcelos, Portugal

Specific goals:
  Development of an algorithm to analyze the display image captured by the camera of the
  embedded system. This algorithm has as objectives to identify the room, date and time
  indicated by the display.
  
Programming language: Python.

  The various topics covered in class will be evaluated in the algorithm developed by
  developed by each group of students:
  
    (1) Image pre-processing.
    
    (2) Detection of the relevant area of the image.
    
    (3) Extraction of the text present in the image region corresponding to the display through OCR.
    
Minimum Requirements:
    For assessment purposes in the Image Processing and Computer Vision UC, each group of students must demonstrate competencies in the extraction of text from a dataset previously previously created by each group for this purpose. The solution must be developed and tested based on this dataset. Each group of students must prepare a jupyter notebook with a demonstration of the developed algorithm, including:
    
    ● Code in Python.

    ● Identification and explanation of the options taken, framing them in the various topics.
    taught in class.

    ● Intermediate image processing results at each step of the algorithm.

Delivery:

  ● Jupyter notebook.

  ● Dataset.
